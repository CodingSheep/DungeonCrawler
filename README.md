##Title
  That One Dungeon Crawler
##Description

  A game that uses a rhythm game like interaction as a pivotal part of the base game mechanic. This game will be a dungeon crawler-esk 2.5d isometric rouge-like hack and slash. Made in Unity.

##Vision Statement

  "To deliver smooth interactive gameplay mechanics, and a game I could show off playing." 
Motivation:
  We all want to make a game that we would want to play.
  
##Risks

  C# is fairly new to some people on the team. 
  Large soft projects are also a new endevour for many of us. 
  Art and assets might be hard to account for. 
  And no experience working with eachother.
  
##Mitigation
  The more experienced people will take time to teach the less experienced people how to use C# and Unity. And frequent communication.
  We will focus on organization and delegate tasks in a reasonable and productive manner.
  Simple geometric models, and dedication to creating assests.
  Frequent communication.
